# OHAI

- 🐳 docker ALL the things (inspired by [@jessfraz](https://github.com/jessfraz)).
- 💎 RUBY OR DIE.
- 🚑 It's fun until it's in prod.
- 😻 [Git**HUB** Flow](https://github.blog/2012-08-29-deploying-at-github/) is the **only** way to go.

Started in ecommerce, fullstack, moved into SRE (still have code in prod!).

Particularly fond of hardware & linux sys-admin things. Love Ruby. If that's not professional enough, golang and python then 😅
